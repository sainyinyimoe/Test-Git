00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.760
 Every filmmaker knows that music gives you a more important, important dimension on the wall. 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.880
 Like Kinofan, the film music is one of the most important elements. 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.690
 It's not easy to find the right music or compose it. Able to change businesses across borders, changing the environment of KI. 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.560
 I am Arjun Dutt at NVIDIA and you say "I Am AI". 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:35.340
 For me as composers, there is nothing worse than a Schreibblockade. Thereby, one algorithm has been developed, which can be used to compose a series of seven curves of music. So we can find our demos extremely fast and unsuspecting customers. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.140
 AIVA is a regular intelligence that composes music for movies, series, games and other support media. 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.740
 Everywhere you hope, it was biser. 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:54.120
 We develop, develop a deep-learning algorithm, write the music on the level of the best composers, as well as music full of emotions. 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.880
 Once again, these emotional features have been sung, as if they were looking for an original composition for the annual NVIDIA conference on the theme KI. 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:16.850
 Get started with NVIDIA GTC projects NVIDIA on. We speak about the AIVA function list. Fortunately, NVIDIA is on the Keynote front hat, giving a clear vision of intelligent intelligence. 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.880
 We wanted to compose in the AIVA names, the music for the video to compose. 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.970
 It is very interesting to know who the creative process can do. Some wanted to erase, where AIVA was white, they should be components. 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.940
 We sat down until we were ashamed and told by the customers, he was sick. 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.240
 Will the Stück emotional be said? 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.880
 Or freaky? 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.850
 This is to say: "Gut, I need you to learn the style of this or your composers." 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.010
 It may refer to the musical style of Mozart or Beethoven. 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:58.100
 Jedes Project is different. Im got some of NVIDIA's a few pieces as a monster. We conclude that a data base of this kind is similar, and trains AIVA no. 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.650
 Who is from AIVA a composer for classical music? 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.220
 This basic image features a rich database of classic music that speaks in MIDI format. 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.690
 So the computer knows every note and the chord of the music, including tempo and rhythm. 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.450
 Mithilfe's recurring neuronal noses aspire to a well-known title to Mustern, to the basic legends of Musikstil. 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.240
 AIVA übt then, indemnate, which note has come in next as Next. 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.920
 Sobald s right sound is darin, it creates a set of rules for this kind of music. 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.026
 Then it is prepared, only to compose an original track. 

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:48.920
 Das klingt ja unglaublich. Aber was holding AIVA by, just cutting out of various pieces "writing" and naming the original as original composition? 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:03.020
 GPU Computing has developed a Plagiarism Checker that recognizes the database plagiarism that is used in all areas, or only out-of-pocket behavior. 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.360
 So much so that you can get rid of the music, orchestrate the piece of music experts. 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.240
 The music is therefore included in a piano-an orchestra piece, as the voices for various instruments are refined. 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.530
 If the customer is satisfied with the award, you will be left with an orchestra. 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.053
 Un, deux, trois, et ... 

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:37.240
 I was surprised that emotional was that music. Of course, it is because there are still many people involved in mind. 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.970
 Can KI still give another step? 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.770
 You can look at music exhibits about music styles. 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:59.373
 Aber has been playing or conducting, ever being conducting, I have to say in the middle of the music. 

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:18.690
 Even so, for composers and musicians, many alternatives are available, if they are regaining technology like masturbation, even better. 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.420
 We meet the needs of the custom intelligence repository. Specifically, the functions are in sin. 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.730
 The first thing is a good day for music. 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.170
 AIVA was there in the Low, in exchange, whether Music is good or not. Your bisher is descending every man. 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:42.690
 We agree that the AI ​​will either observe or not comply with the Customer's appointments. 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.280
 The second goal is that AIVA has the ability to directly compose music for a whole orchestra. 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:58.400
 As an actor, AIVA should, in the low sense, read the scripts for a movie or a video game, extraordinary to the Matrix and emotions and transfer them directly to that music. 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.000
 Also, if the question is whether AIVA is really a composer, it has made it plain. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 AIVA is officially recognized by SACEM, a free organization that protects the dishonest of composers. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.120
 If an official intelligence of an organization for dishonesty is recognized, all your works are protected by law. 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:31.066
 I am the tutor of this artificial intelligence, until it becomes more independant, executes and still has more legal rights.
